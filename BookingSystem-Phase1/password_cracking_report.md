# Password Cracking Report

## 1. Introduction

This report documents the process used to crack passwords from the Phase 2 Booking System lab. Hashcat and dictionary attacks were used to recover passwords.

## 3. Questions & Answers

### **Q1: What is the main difference between Dictionary and Non‑Dictionary attacks?**

A **dictionary attack** uses a list of real passwords (like rockyou.txt) and checks each one to see if it matches the hash.  
A **non-dictionary attack** tries every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols (brute force) instead of using real words.

**Simple summary:**  
- **Dictionary = tries common passwords.**  
- **Non-dictionary = tries every possible password.

---

### **Q2: What advantage does an attacker gain by having access to the system's database that reveals users and password hashes?**

If an attacker gets the database, they can see all the usernames and the password hashes.  
They can try to crack the passwords **offline** without triggering alarms or rate limits.

**Simple summary:**  
- Crack passwords secretly.  
- Try millions of guesses quickly.  
- Target specific users.

---

### **Q3: What security benefits are achieved by using longer passwords?**

Longer passwords take much more time to crack because the number of possible combinations grows a lot with each extra character.

**Simple summary:**  
- Longer passwords = harder to brute-force.  
- Protect against fast cracking tools like Hashcat.  
- Even simple long passwords are stronger than short ones.

## 4. Conclusion

Five passwords were successfully cracked using dictionary and stdin-based hashcat techniques. The results demonstrate why weak or short passwords are insecure.
